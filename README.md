## 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Pineda
  Aspiring Coder | Ambitious Learner 

I'm an eager computer science major currently enrolled at FIU. I enjoy learning new concepts related to both coding and technology. 
I love treating coding situations like puzzles, which helps me enjoy the process more. With a background in a team sport like soccer, 
I thrive in team-oriented situations.

My current interests relate to projects involving web development, software development, AI, and game development. While experience is 
one thing I currently lack, I have dabbled in game development projects (INIT Build) and basic web development.
